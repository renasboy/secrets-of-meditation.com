<h3>02. INTRODUCTION (Why This Guide and Contents)</h3>
<li>The decision to write this short practical guide on meditation was initiated after going through a considerable amount of content and still not fully grasping it.</li>
<li>After reading multiple books, numerous online articles, and watching numerous videos, it became apparent that the contents were often very similar.</li>
<li>Following lessons and practical sessions with professional guides did not yield much evolution, as the information shared was largely the same.</li>
<li>In the end, it all boils down to this: sit down quietly without moving, empty the mind, and focus on the breath.</li>
<li>This does not sound very logical; if the mind is empty, how can it focus on anything, given that the mind is used to applying focus?</li>
<li>Only after years of continuous and prolonged daily practice did some aspects, never mentioned before, become noticeable and clear.</li>
<li>These aspects are the central content of this short practical guide and gave rise to the title: Secrets of Meditation.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the content sections are presented in a logical progression from theory to practice, hence the second part of the title.</li>
<li>Hopefully, this practical content and style become easy to follow and help enlighten the path to a meditative state of mind.</li>

                                                                     (Ego Programus)</div>

<h3>03. WHAT MEDITATION IS NOT (Before Explaining What it is)</h3>
<li>Not easy</li>
<li>Not doing nothing</li>
<li>Not sitting still without moving</li>
<li>Not emptying the mind and thinking of nothing</li>
<li>Not thinking or letting the mind wander about the past and future</li>
<li>Not reflecting or analyzing a situation and feeling emotions about it</li>
<li>Not a solution for everything</li>
<br/>
<h3>04. WHAT IS MEDITATION (In Short)</h3>
<li>Is hard and intense</li>
<li>Is a practice to be actively exercised in sessions</li>
<li>Is control over the body and mind</li>
<li>Is uninterrupted, prolonged concentration on a chosen object</li>
<li>Is presence in the current moment, the present, here and now</li>
<li>Is a process to restrain the mind by removing distractions</li>
<li>Is a path to enlightenment and unity</li>
<br/>
<h3>05. THEORY (How to Practice Meditation)</h3>
<li>Meditation is challenging because, during the initial stages, the mind has to be used to control itself.</li>
<li>The goal is to maintain a continuous flow of cognition on a chosen object for as long as possible.</li>
<li>By controlling the breath, the first and most common object of concentration is used, which is the breath itself.</li>
<li>Therefore, visualization and imagination play an important role during meditation practice before uninterrupted concentration is mastered.</li>
<li>Visualizing anything that can be imagined about the chosen object helps maintain focus and concentration.</li>
<li>However, distractions will inevitably occur, and upon realization of the distraction, focus should return to the chosen object.</li>
<li>This process of concentration and distractions repeats multiple times in loop cycles.</li>
<li>This loop cycle of trying to concentrate and re-concentrate on the chosen object is called meditation practice.</li>
<li>When concentration is achieved for a prolonged and uninterrupted period, it can be considered and called meditation.</li>
<li>Meditation practice is done in sessions, which are repeated possibly multiple times daily and vary according to availability.</li>
<li>Each session is different, as it depends on the current state of mind; however, with effort and determination, progress is noticed.</li>
<li>The state of mind before practice starts should be: there is nothing else at this moment, apart from myself, here, with the object of focus.</li>
<li>Once meditation is mastered, it is possible to achieve contemplation with absorption; however, this is beyond the topic of meditation.</li>
<li>During absorptive contemplation, the experience excludes the mind and merges with the chosen object, bypassing the mind.</li>
<br/>
<h3>06. ENERGY CENTRES (The So-Called Chakras)</h3>
<li>There are hundreds of energy centres spread throughout the whole body.</li>
<li>However, the seven largest and most important ones are along the spine and head.</li>
<li>These seven energy centres are located inside the spine or head and not at skin level.</li>
<li>Their names are indicative of the height along the spine or head where they are located.</li>
<li>Each energy centre is represented by a visual light colour that helps during visualization.</li>
<li>The colours correspond in the same order as the rainbow colours, from the first (red, at the bottom) to the seventh (violet, at the top).</li>
<li>The first is the root centre, located at the very bottom of the spine, almost in contact with the floor when seated, represented by the colour red.</li>
<li>The second is the sacral centre, located at the height of the sexual organs, represented by the colour orange.</li>
<li>The third is the solar plexus centre, located at the navel height (belly button), represented by the colour yellow.</li>
<li>The fourth is the heart centre, located at the height of the heart, in the middle of the chest, represented by the colour green.</li>
<li>The fifth is the throat centre, located at the height of the throat and neck, represented by the colour blue.</li>
<li>The sixth is the third eye centre, located at the height of the forehead, represented by the colour purple.</li>
<li>The seventh is the crown centre, located at the height of the scalp, at the top of the head, almost outside the body, represented by the colour violet (or white).</li>
<li>During practice, breath is used together with visualization techniques to help the mind unclog the energy centres, one by one.</li>
<br/>
<h3>07. CLOTHING (How to Dress)</h3>
<li>It is important to wear comfortable and suitable clothing.</li>
<li>Comfortable clothing allows for uninterrupted and prolonged practice.</li>
<li>Ideally, wear loose attire, such as pyjamas or a robe.</li>
<li>Avoid elastics or anything too tight.</li>
<li>Avoid any type of shoes; socks are fine.</li>
<li>Avoid caps or hats, ties, and belts.</li>
<li>Avoid glasses, pulse watches, bracelets, rings, earrings, or accessories in general.</li>
<br/>
<h3>08. LOCATION (Where to Practice)</h3>
<li>Choose a quiet place with as few interruptions and distractions as possible; turn off mobile phones.</li>
<li>Initially, practice indoors; after gaining some experience, outdoor practice is also possible.</li>
<li>Select a location protected from too bright light, with a temperature that is neither too warm nor too cold; avoid cold wind currents.</li>
<li>Ideally, use the same spot whenever possible to facilitate the creation of a routine.</li>
<br/>
<h3>09. DURATION (How Long to Practice)</h3>
<li>Reserve time to engage in proper practice when nothing else is necessary or requiring attention.</li>
<li>Session duration usually depends on the time available, as well as the state of mind and posture.</li>
<li>Start with a 5-minute session, incorporating a simple breath control exercise.</li>
<li>Extend to 15 minutes by including a body scan, focusing on different parts of the body while controlling the breath.</li>
<li>Extend to 30 minutes by adding focus on the energy centres instead of a body scan, while controlling the breath.</li>
<li>Extend to 45 minutes by choosing something enlightening and elevated to focus on after unclogging the energy centres with visualization.</li>
<li>A session duration of 60 minutes is not uncommon nowadays, although historically, sessions could last for days, weeks, or even months.</li>
<li>If anxiety arises during the practice to hurry and finalize the session for other tasks, this is not meditation.</li>
<li>The best tip is to be present, focus on the current moment, practice concentration, and forget about time; this is meditation.</li>
<br/>
<h3>10. TIMING (When to Practice)</h3>
<li>Ideally, make it the first activity in the morning, right after waking up.</li>
<li>Begin with one session in the morning before breakfast.</li>
<li>Extend to one more session in the evening before sleep.</li>
<li>Alternatively, choose any other convenient time, always ensuring there are fewer or no distractions.</li>
<li>Later on, extend to as many sessions as desired depending on availability.</li>
<li>Ideally, practice at the same time consistently, if possible, to facilitate the creation of a routine.</li>
<br/>
<h3>11. POSTURE (How to Sit and Position the Body)</h3>
<li>It is essential to find a comfortable posture.</li>
<li>Essentially, the posture should be comfortable, relaxed, yet steady and present.</li>
<li>A comfortable posture allows for uninterrupted and prolonged practice.</li>
<li>The most important aspect is to maintain a straight spine, including the lower back, back, neck, and head.</li>
<li>During extended inhalation, check that the spine is steady and properly straight.</li>
<li>Position the nose and chin neither too high nor too low; imagine a puppet hanging by its ears.</li>
<li>The most common posture is a seated position, although standing or lying down is not uncommon, keeping the spine straight at all times.</li>
<li>The use of a chair is also common, as long as both feet touch the ground, the spine remains straight, and there is no leaning on back support.</li>
<li>Keep the legs relaxed, ideally in the famous lotus position; however, half-lotus or simply crossed legs are also suitable, gradually progressing towards the lotus position.</li>
<li>Allow the hands to rest relaxed over the lap, with palms up above each other and thumbs slightly touching.</li>
<li>Alternatively, the hands can rest relaxed over the knees with palms up, while the middle finger slightly touches the thumb.</li>
<li>Ideally, keep the eyes slightly open; however, it is possible to begin with closed eyes to avoid distractions and open them along the session gradually.</li>
<li>Keep the eyes relaxed, avoid moving or focusing on anything, with the gaze pointing down in the nose direction.</li>
<li>Keep the mouth closed, relaxed, with the jaw and tongue resting.</li>
<li>In case of pain or discomfort, try to concentrate and relax the affected body part; if it does not help, adjust the posture.</li>
<li>Anything can be adjusted during the session, especially the legs; find balance and recentre until the optimal posture is mastered.</li>
<li>Do not feel pressured to remain still or unchanged; adjust and adapt until a steady comfort is achieved.</li>
<li>It is okay to sneeze, cough, or clear the throat if it happens.</li>
<li>Sitting on a firm, stable, and low (but not too soft) cushion or pillow can be helpful.</li>
<li>Stretching the body before and after the session can also be beneficial.</li>
<br/>
<h3>12. BREATHING (How to Control the Breath)</h3>
<li>Breathing is done exclusively through the nostrils.</li>
<li>Utilize breath control and regulation techniques, where exhalation is longer than inhalation and includes a short suspension.</li>
<li>Control the breath at the throat, serving as a valve and producing a characteristic subtle sound.</li>
<li>The goal is to have long and slow movements that evolve with practice, extending little by little with every cycle and session.</li>
<li>During extended inhalation, straighten up the back, neck, and head until the lungs are totally full, all the way through.</li>
<li>During suspension, for just a brief moment, relax the abdomen and navel area, the belly, and loosen the legs.</li>
<li>Suspension is supposed to be brief and comfortable; the lungs should not crave air, and with practice, control is mastered.</li>
<li>Exhalation is done as extended and slow as possible, consistent and almost imperceptible.</li>
<li>During exhalation, the diaphragm muscle may get tired and sore; it helps to slightly inhale to relax the muscle and continue the exhalation process.</li>
<li>This technique to relax the diaphragm can be used repeatedly until the lungs are totally empty.</li>
<li>At the end of the extended and slow exhalation, slightly lower the torso, like bowing forward, and exhale until the lungs are totally empty.</li>
<li>If the lungs crave air and interrupt the flow, first try controlling it; if not possible, try a less extended cycle next.</li>
<li>Once mastered, a breathing cycle, including inhalation, suspension, and exhalation, can take up to 3 minutes per single cycle.</li>
<li>Those 3 minutes are divided into 40 seconds of inhalation, 20 seconds of suspension, and 120 seconds of exhalation, using the diaphragm technique.</li>
<br/>
<h3>13. VISUALIZATION (How to Guide the Mind into the Flow and Unclog Energy Centres)</h3>
<li>Visualization is done together with breathing, using breath as a guide to unclog energy centres; everything happens in the mind.</li>
<li>Visualize the internal of the spine as an energy tube or pipe where energy can flow up and down when unclogged.</li>
<li>Visualize the energy flowing up and down the energy tube while breathing in and out, during inhalation and exhalation.</li>
<li>Visualize the seven energy centres along the spine: root, sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye, and crown, represented by colours.</li>
<li>Visualize the energy centres being unclogged by each breath cycle, one by one, from the bottom up, so that the energy can flow freely inside the body.</li>
<li>During inhalation, visualize the energy moving slowly up the tube, unclogging the energy centres along the way, one at a time.</li>
<li>During breath suspension, visualize the energy concentrating and spinning in place, inside the spine at the position of the energy centre.</li>
<li>During exhalation, visualize the energy concentrated in place, inside the spine, at the highest unclogged energy centre.</li>
<li>With every breath cycle, visualize that the breath helps to clean the energy tube and unclog the next energy centre.</li>
<li>Visualize that when the energy tube is clean, energy can flow freely from root to crown or any other energy centre.</li>
<li>Visualize that while straightening the back, neck, and head, the energy can flow easily.</li>
<li>Visualize the energy flowing via the magnetic field of the body, up through the spine from root to crown, and then down around the body from crown to root.</li>
<br/>
<h3>14. SENSATIONS (What the Body Senses During Practice)</h3>
<li>Sensations are not the goal of meditation; therefore, do not expect or search for them, although they can occur at any moment during deep practice.</li>
<li>Sensations are closer to body feelings; they are not thoughts and emerge spontaneously and unconsciously.</li>
<li>Sense body lightness, full-body relaxation, and calming, including head lightness.</li>
<li>Sense alternation between warm and cold waves of energy through body extremities and limbs, accompanied by tingles.</li>
<li>Sense heart pounding, chest pounding, or whole-body pulsing, accompanied by waves of energy flowing through the body.</li>
<li>Sense a bright warm light coming from above, as if illumination is closer, noticeable even with eyes closed.</li>
<li>Sense the whole body slightly tingling, accompanied by variations of warm and cold waves of energy spreading.</li>
<li>Sense strong tingling through the body and head, especially the brain area, spreading through the spine, followed by slight dizziness.</li>
<li>Visualize one single fixed tiny dot of light in the middle of the visual field where energy flows around, and all visual forms derive from it.</li>
<li>If eyes are closed, they might start to slightly open by themselves, unconsciously.</li>
<li>The mouth might form a slight uncontrolled smile of gratitude, unconsciously.</li>
<li>Sense a sudden silence, as if everything became quiet all at once, and calm reigns altogether.</li>
<li>The body might adjust itself to find a more comfortable posture, re-centering, or repositioning the hands, unconsciously.</li>
<li>Feel a sense of oneness with everything and everyone; after all, everything is how it should be and where it belongs.</li>
<li>When the illumination state is closer or reached, the sun might shine through and come out for a moment, even on a rainy day.</li>
<li>Once sensations arise, do not be afraid to lose yourself and let yourself flow with the energy, surfing the energy.</li>
<li>Feel other dimensions of this universe spinning around yourself; sometimes, it also happens to visualize them in flashes.</li>
<li>Ultimately, enjoy all sensations together, combined and stronger, as if rolling out of this reality.</li>
<br/>
<h3>15. PRACTICE (Hands-On Step-by-Step Practice)</h3>
<li>Meditation practice is personal and individual, not done in a group; it is for the self and not for others.</li>
<li>Start with a little body stretching, especially arms, legs, back, and neck; this helps endure the posture.</li>
<li>Sit down on a firm cushion and choose a comfortable crossed-legs position, relaxed and steady.</li>
<li>Optionally, light up an incense, which is recommended and helps to relax.</li>
<li>Optionally, close the eyes partially letting some light come through or fully to avoid distractions.</li>
<li>Warm up both hands by quickly rubbing them against each other and then spreading the warmth around the body.</li>
<li>Spread by rubbing hands through the face, warm up the head, arms, repeating for chest, abdomen, and legs.</li>
<li>Place hands together, palm with palm in front of the chest, at heart height; this position represents union.</li>
<li>Take a slow, deep inhalation while slowly raising both hands together until they are in front of the forehead.</li>
<li>Hold the breath for a little while, keeping hands united in front of the forehead in the meantime.</li>
<li>Exhale slowly while also slowly lowering hands, united together, returning to the initial position in front of the chest.</li>
<li>At the end of exhalation, with hands still united, slowly bow two or three times while expelling all air from lungs.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps two or three times, optionally raising united hands higher than the forehead, to the crown or all the way up.</li>
<li>Separate the hands while stretching the back, chest, and arms, then choose a comfortable arms and hands position while exhaling all air.</li>
<li>At this point, start the visualization process, with the intention to unclog the energy centres and energy flow.</li>
<li>Take a slow deep inhalation while visualizing the energy flowing to the first energy centre, root, with the colour red.</li>
<li>Suspend the breath for a while, not too much to crave for air; check body posture, straighten the back, relax and let loose the belly.</li>
<li>Release the air as slowly as possible, controlling exhalation, always without a craving for air using diaphragm technique until the lungs are empty.</li>
<li>Repeat this breath cycle two more times for the first energy centre, root, red, so three in total per energy centre.</li>
<li>Repeat this breath cycle three times for each successive energy centre, so 21 breath cycles in total for the seven energy centres.</li>
<li>After 21 breath cycles, the actual meditation practice with a focus object starts; choose a mental object of concentration.</li>
<li>Focus on the chosen object and keep breathing all the way from the first, root, red, to the seventh, crown, violet energy centre.</li>
<li>Try to stay concentrated for as long as possible on the chosen object without interruptions or distractions.</li>
<li>Whenever distraction arises, recognize it and return focus to the chosen object of concentration; this is the actual practice.</li>
<li>Constantly check on the posture and adjust or adapt if necessary; back, head, arms, or legs until a comfortable posture is mastered.</li>
<li>At the end of the practice, repeat the initial steps raising and lowering united hands together, a couple of bows during the end of exhalation.</li>
<li>The meditation practice is done; slowly move the body out of position, stretch and stand up, continue to have a great day.</li>
<li>This practice can be repeated as many times as necessary, once mastered, also with possible variations.</li>
<br/>

<li>Meditation might be challenging but not impossible.</li>
<li>With dedication, meditation practice can be mastered.</li>
<li>Meditation brings long term benefits when practice becomes a routine.</li>
